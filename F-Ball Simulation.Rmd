```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(Rlab)
```

## Instantiating Counts 
```{r}
state <- list()
state$down <- 1 
state$downyards <- 0 
state$totyards <- 0 
state$totdowns <- 0 
```

## Down Check 

**Functions: touchdown_check ; firstdown_check ; fourthdown_check**

These functions will be called within both the pass and run play functions to see if after the given play, the team has either reached a touch down, reached a first down, or ran out of downs before reaching 10 yards.

```{r}
touchdown_check <- function(tot_yrd){
  if (tot_yrd >= 75){
    return(TRUE)
  }}
firstdown_check <- function(d_yrd, d_cnt){
  if(d_yrd >= 10){
    d_cnt <- 1
    d_yrd <- 0
    down_info <- c(d_cnt, d_yrd)
    return(down_info)
  }else{
    down_info <- c(d_cnt, d_yrd)
    return(down_info)
  }
}
fourthdown_check <- function(d_cnt){
  if (d_cnt > 4){
    return(FALSE)
  }
}
```

## Run Play

If the play decision is a run play, this function will call and randomly choose a number for the yardage from a normal distribution. It will then call the check functions instantiated above.

```{r}
run_play <- function(){
  #randomly sample from normal distribution to return yardage of run
  yardage <- round(rnorm(1, mean = 3, sd = 3))
  d_yrd <- d_yrd + yardage
  tot_yrd <- tot_yrd + yardage
  tot_down <- tot_down + 1
  d_cnt <- d_cnt +1
  
  #checking if we have reached a touchdown, first down, or ran out of plays
  touchdown_check(tot_yrd)
  d_cnt <- firstdown_check(d_yrd, d_cnt)[1]
  d_yrd <- firstdown_check(d_yrd, d_cnt)[2]
  fourthdown_check(d_cnt)
}
```

## Pass Play

If the play decision is a pass play, this function will call and randomly choose a number for the yardage from a log-normal distribution. Given this number, we assign an exponential function to determine the probability this will be a completed pass (since longer passes have a lower probability of being completed). This probability is the parameter in a Bernoulli distribution that we use to determine if the pass was completed or not. It will then call the check functions instantiated above. 

```{r}
pass_play <- function(){
  #Randomly sample numbers from log distribution for yardage
  yardage <- 0
  while ((yardage < 3) | (yardage > 75)){
  yardage <- rlnorm(1, mean = log(10), sd = 1)
  yardage <- round(yardage)
  }
  #Given his pass is of length 'yardage,' 
  #what is the probability that he can complete a pass of this length?
  p_comp_fn <- function(yardage){
    m <- .97
    p_comp <- m^(yardage)
    return(p_comp)
  }
  p_comp <- p_comp_fn(yardage)
  complete_check <- rbern(1, prob = p_comp)
  complete_check
  if(complete_check ==1){
   state$down <- state$down +1 
  state$downyards <-  state$downyards + yards
  state$totyards <- state$totyards + yards
  state$totdowns <-  state$totdowns + 1
  }else{
    tate$totyards <- state$totyards + yards
    state$down <- state$down +1
  }
}

```
